      <ol>
       <li>Like any other survivor pool, once you pick a team once, you may not pick that same team again.</li>
       <li>Picks are made on a day-by-day basis and not round-by-round.</li>
       <li>Picks must be made prior to tip off of the first game for every single day. Even if your team/teams do not play until night.</li>
       <li>Below is how many picks are required to be made each day if you are correct:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Thursday - 2 picks</li>
          <li>Friday -   2 picks</li>
          <li>Saturday - 1 pick</li>
          <li>Sunday -   1 pick</li>
          <li>Every following day is also 1 pick.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If you pick incorrectly, you are out unless you re-enter the game.</li>
      </ol>
    <h4>Re-entering the Game:</h4>
      <ol>  
        <li>Each player has the chance to rejoin the game, but it will cost you another entry for each re-entry as well as more games to pick.</li>
        <li>Below is the schedule for how many games you will need to pick in order re-enter the game and advance:</li>

      <ul>
          <li>If you get any wrong on Thursday, must pick 4 winners on Friday. If all 4 on Friday are correct, you will advance and will only need to pick 1 winner Saturday.</li>

          <li>If you get any wrong on Friday, must pick 5 winners on Saturday. If all 5 on Saturday are correct, you will advance and will only need to pick 1 winner Sunday.</li>

          <li>If you get any wrong Saturday, must pick 6 winners on Sunday. If all 6 on Sunday are correct, you will advance and will only need to pick one winner on Thursday of the 2nd week.</li>
      </ul>
       <li>This is a survivor pool, and the reason for the above is to make it more difficult for those who have already picked a loser. You can re-enter as many times as you would like, but the last day to re-enter would be Sunday of the first weekend.</li> 
       <li>If you pick any loser on Sunday or beyond, you can not re-enter Please note, just because you re-enter, it does not reset the teams you can choose from.</li>
       <li>In the event that you have advanced and do not have anyone else remaining to choose from, you would still tie any player that does not correctly guess the next round.</li>
       <ul>
       <li>For instance, if Steve were to have no remaining teams left after Sunday, but only Dave was left and he did not pick a winner on the next day of picks, Steve and Dave would tie and split the pot.</li>
      </ul>
      </ol>
